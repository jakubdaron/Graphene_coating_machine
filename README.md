**Graphene coating machine**

In this project we showcase a budget machine for creating graphene coatings on work surfaces of wire forming die based on technology described in patent  PL 239477.

The machine was built using budget and easly accessible components as well as 3D printed parts. 
It consists of a linear Z-axis and a turntable that is outfited with pressure sensor and allows for full 360deg rotation.
Z axis allows the electrode to put pressure on the die in range of 0,5 - 5kg, set by user. 
Pressure sensor readings allow the pressure to be in range of 5 - 15% error tolerance depending on the quallity of sensor calibration.


DISCLAIMER:
Presented machine is an academic proof of concept and is not sutable for industrial aplication in it's current version. 
This project was done on behest and with guidance from patent owner for the technology as a proof of concept.
